# Widgets
Custom website widgets developed to be organized, high performance, and modular.

## Overview
Each widget is a self contained piece of functionality that can be added to a website.

I will try to always provide a working example if possible, or adequate setup instructions, but I do not guarantee this for all items in this repository. I will also try to reference or document external content, whether it be libraries or frameworks, used or required to edit source code. I'm a believer in less is more, so I will strive to minimize the number of dependencies.

## Contributing
I do not offer the ability to contribute at this time, as this is my personal repository. However I am open to collaborating on a separate repository to include some or all of my public repositories.

## Support or Contact
I do not offer support, but you may contact me if you wish through my website at [joshuabalsillie.com](https://joshuabalsillie.com)
